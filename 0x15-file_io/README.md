# C - FILE I/O

## Help (using man):
* open
* close
* read
* write
* dprintf

### Objectives
* How to create, open, read and write files
* What are file descriptiors?
* What are the 3 standard file descriptors, what purpose and what are their POSIX names?
* How to use the I/O system calls `open`, `close`, `read`, and `write`.
* What is a system call?

#### Requirements:
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using options `-Wall`, `-Werror`, `-Wextra`, `-pedantic`, `-std=gnu89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etc.. is forbidden.
* Allowed syscalls: `read`, `write`, `open`, `close`.
* All codes used the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* Tip: always prefer using symbolic constants (POSIX) vs numbers when it makes sense. For instance read(STDIN_FILENO, ... vs read(0, ...
